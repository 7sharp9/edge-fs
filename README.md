edge-fs
=======

This is an F# compiler for edge.js.  

At the moment Im preparing the release of the MKII compiler which is an out of process compiler (The C# Edge compiler is also an out of process compiler.).  

The MKI Compiler is an in procees compiler but has a few performance issues between the node, C++ CLI, and F# compiler, which Im looking into at the momnet.  

See [edge.js overview](http://tjanczuk.github.com/edge) and [edge.js on GitHub](https://github.com/tjanczuk/egde) for more information.

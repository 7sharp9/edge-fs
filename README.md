edge-fs
=======

This is an experimental F# compiler for edge.js.  

At the moment it's in alpha testing and has a few performance issues between the C++ CLI and the F# compiler, which Im looking into.  

See [edge.js overview](http://tjanczuk.github.com/edge) and [edge.js on GitHub](https://github.com/tjanczuk/egde) for more information.
